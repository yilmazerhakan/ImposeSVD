name: 'ImposeSVD: Incrementing PureSVD for top-N recommendations for cold-start problems
  and sparse datasets'
description: In this paper, we introduced two novel collaborative filtering techniques
  for recommendation systems in cases of various cold-start situations and incomplete
  datasets. The first model establishes an asymmetric weight matrix between items
  without using item meta-data and eradicates the disadvantages of neighborhood approaches
  by automatic determination of threshold values. Our first model, z-scoREC, is also
  regarded as a pure deep-learning model because it performs like a vanilla auto-encoder
  in transforming column vectors with z-score normalization similar to batch normalization.
  With the second model, ImposeSVD, we aimed to enhance the shortcomings of the PureSVD
  in cases of cold-start and incomplete data by preserving its straightforward implementation
  and non-parametric form. The ImposeSVD model relies on the z-scoREC, produces synthetic
  new predictions for the users by decomposing the latent factors from the imposed
  matrix. We evaluated our method on the well-known datasets and found out that our
  method was outperforming similar approaches in the specific scenarios including
  recommendations for cold-start users, strength in cold-start systems, and diversification
  of long-tail item recommendations in lists. Our z-scoREC model also outperformed
  familiar neighbor-based approaches when operated as a recommender system and gave
  a closer appearance to the decomposition methods despite its simple and rigid cost
  framework.
